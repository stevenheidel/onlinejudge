    <h1>Problem A: Happy Camper</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>camper.{c,cpp,java}</tt>

    <p>
      As Happy Camper Harry pulls into his favorite campground with his family, he notices the sign: 'Campground occupancy is limited to 10 days within any consecutive 20-day period.' Harry is just starting a 28-day vacation. What is the maximum number of days he can occupy a campsite during his vacation?
    </p>
    <p>
      We state the problem in more general terms. Suppose that 1 &lt; L &lt; P &lt; V are integers. Campground occupancy is limited to L days within any consecutive P-day period. Happy Camper Harry is just starting a V-day vacation. What is the maximum number of days he can occupy a campsite during his vacation?
    </p>
    <h1>Input</h1>

    <p>
      The input will contain data for a number of test cases. For each test case, there will be one line of data, containing values of L, P and V, in that order. All input integers can be represented by signed 32-bit integers. End of data will be signaled by a line containing three zeros, which will not be processed.
    </p>

    <h1>Output</h1>
    <p>
      There will be one line of output for each test case. It will display the case number and the number of days Happy Camper Harry can occupy a campsite during his vacation. The format is illustrated by the sample output.
