    <h1>Problem H: Trees</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>trees.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <p>
      A graph consists of a set of vertices and edges between pairs of vertices. Two vertices are connected if there is a path (subset of edges) leading from one vertex to another, and a connected component is a maximal subset of vertices that are all connected to each other. A graph consists of one or more connected components.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tree is a connected component without cycles, but it can also be characterized in other ways. For example, a tree consisting of n vertices has exactly n-1 edges. Also, there is a unique path connecting any pair of vertices in a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a graph, report the number of connected components that are also trees.
    </p>
    <h1>Input</h1>

    <p>
      The input consists of a number of cases. Each case starts with two non-negative integers <tt>n</tt> and <tt>m</tt>, satisfying <tt>n &le; 500</tt> and <tt>m &le; n(n-1)/2</tt>. This is followed by m lines, each containing two integers specifying the two distinct vertices connected by an edge. No edge will be specified twice (or given again in a different order). The vertices are labelled <tt>1</tt> to <tt>n</tt>. The end of input is indicated by a line containing <tt>n = m = 0</tt>.
    </p>

    <h1>Output</h1>
    <p>
      For each case, print one of the following lines depending on how many different connected components are trees (T > 1 below):
      <pre>
	Case x: A forest of T trees.
	Case x: There is one tree.
	Case x: No trees.
      </pre>

    <p>
      <tt>x</tt> is the case number (starting from 1).
    </p>
