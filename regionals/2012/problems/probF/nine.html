    <h1>Problem F: Nine</h1>

    <p>
      Randall Munroe from <tt>xkcd.com</tt> pointed out that 9 is the most rarely used key on a microwave. Let's all share the load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a desired cooking time, find a sequence of keys with the greatest number of 9's such that the resulting time has less than 10% error compared to the desired cooking time. In other words, if <tt>T</tt> is the desired cooking time in seconds, and <tt>T9</tt> is the cooking time specified by the found sequence, then <tt>10|T - T9| &lt; T</tt>. If there are multiple possibilities, choose the one that has the smallest error (in magnitude). If there are still ties, choose the one that is lexicographically smallest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, for T = 01:15, the times 00:68-00:82 and 1:08-1:22 have less than 10% error. Of these, 00:69, 00:79, 01:09, and 01:19 have the greatest number of 9's, and the ones with the smallest error are 00:79 and 01:19. The lexicographically smaller of these is 00:79.
    </p>
    <h1>Input</h1>

    <p>
      The input consists of a number of cases. For each case, the desired cooking time in <tt>MM:SS</tt> format is specified on one line. Each <tt>M</tt> or <tt>S</tt> can be any digit from 0 to 9. The end of input is indicated by 00:00.
    </p>

    <h1>Output</h1>
    <p>
      For each case, output on a single line the four keys to use as input to the microwave, in <tt>MM:SS</tt> format.
    </p>
