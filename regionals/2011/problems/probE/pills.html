    <h1>Problem E: Pills</h1>


    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>pills.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br/><b>Input:</b> <tt>console {stdin,cin,System.in}</tt>
    <br/><b>Output:</b> <tt>console {stdout,cout,System.out}</tt>

<p>Aunt Lizzie takes half a pill of a certain medicine every day. She
starts with a bottle that contains N pills.</p> 

<p>On the first day, she removes a random pill, breaks it in two
halves, takes one half and puts the other half back into the
bottle.</p> 

<p>On subsequent days, she removes a random piece (which can be either
a whole pill or half a pill) from the bottle. If it is half a pill,
she takes it. If it is a whole pill, she takes one half and puts the
other half back into the bottle.</p> 

In how many ways can she empty the bottle? We represent the sequence
of pills removed from the bottle in the course of 2N days as a string,
where the i-th character is W if a whole pill was chosen on the i-th
day, and H if a half pill was chosen (0 <= i < 2N). How many different
valid strings are there that empty the bottle?</p> 

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The input will contain data for at most 1000 problem instances. For each problem instance there will be one line of input: a positive integer N <= 30, the number of pills initially in the bottle. End of input will be indicated by 0.</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>For each problem instance, the output will be a single number, displayed at the beginning of a new line. It will be the number of different ways the bottle can be emptied.</p>
