    <h1>Problem B: Shape Number</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>name.{c,cpp,java}</tt>

<p>In computer vision, a chain code is a sequence of numbers
representing directions when following the contour of an object. For
example, the following figure shows the contour represented by the
chain code 22234446466001207560 (starting at the upper-left
corner).</p>

<p>Two chain codes may represent the same shape if the shape has been
rotated, or if a different starting point is chosen for the
contour. To normalize the code for rotation, we can compute the first
difference of the chain code instead. The first difference is obtained
by counting the number of direction changes in counterclockwise
direction between consecutive elements in the chain code (the last
element is consecutive with the first one). In the above code, the
first difference is</p>
<pre>
00110026202011676122
</pre>
Finally, to normalize for the starting point, we consider all cyclic rotations of the first difference and choose among them the lexicographically smallest such code. The resulting code is called the shape number.
<pre>
00110026202011676122
01100262020116761220
11002620201167612200
...
20011002620201167612
</pre>

<p>In this case, 00110026202011676122 is the shape number of the shape above.</p>
<h1 class="break">Input</h1>
<p>The input consists of a number of cases. The input of each case is given in one line, consisting of a chain code of a shape. The length of the chain code is at most 300,000, and all digits in the code are between 0 and 7 inclusive. The contour may intersect itself and needs not trace back to the starting point.</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>For each case, print the resulting shape number after the normalizations discussed above are performed.</p>
