    <h1>Problem J: Supply Mission</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>supply.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br/><b>Input:</b> <tt>console {stdin,cin,System.in}</tt>
    <br/><b>Output:</b> <tt>console {stdout,cout,System.out}</tt>

<p>You are to fly a helicopter to bring supplies to a number of
submarines that are currently moving across the ocean. You will be
given the coordinates of the helicopter base and each submarine. Each
submarine is travelling constantly at a heading and speed specified by
the velocity vector (vx, vy), meaning that after 1 hour it would have
travelled vx km in the x direction and vy km in the y direction (vx
and vy may be negative). The length of the vector is the speed. The
helicopter is capable of travelling at a constant speed in any
direction (assume that acceleration and deceleration are
instantaneous). The helicopter must land on each submarine at least
once, and it takes 1 hour at each stop to unload the supplies and
refuel. Each submarine rises to the surface at the appropriate landing
time, and submerges once the helicopter leaves. You may assume that
the velocity of each submarine is not affected by any change of its
travelling depth. The helicopter can carry enough supplies for all
submarines without having to return to the base. All coordinates have
km as units, and all velocities and speeds have km/h as units.</p> 

<p>Find the shortest time for the helicopter to bring supplies to each
submarine from the base and return to its base.</p> 

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The input consists of a number of cases. Each case starts with a
line containing the integer N (1 <= N <= 8) specifying the number of
submarines. The next N lines contain 4 integers separated by a space:
the initial (x,y) coordinates of the i-th submarine and its velocity
vector. The last line of each case contains 3 integers specifying the
(x,y) coordinates of the helicopter base and the speed of the
helicopter. The end of input is indicated by a case that starts with N
= 0, and this last case should not be processed. All input integers
have absolute value at most 1000. You may assume that the helicopter
travels at a greater speed than every submarine. Note that the paths
of the submarines may cross each other or even the helicopter base,
but since they can adjust their depth there will be no collisions.</p> 

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>For each case, print its case number, a colon, followed by the minimum amount of time needed to complete the mission in the format:</p>
<pre>
Case a: b hour(s) c minute(s) d second(s)
</pre>
<p>where a, b, c, d are appropriate non-negative integers, and c and d are at most 59. The time should be rounded up to the next second.</p>
