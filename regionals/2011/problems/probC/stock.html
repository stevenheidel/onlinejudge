    <h1>Problem C: Stock Prices</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>stock.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br/><b>Input:</b> <tt>console {stdin,cin,System.in}</tt>
    <br/><b>Output:</b> <tt>console {stdout,cout,System.out}</tt>

<p>Buy low, sell high. That is what one should do to make profit in
the stock market (we will ignore short selling here). Of course, no
one can tell the price of a stock in the future, so it is difficult to
know exactly when to buy and sell and how much profit one can make by
repeatedly buying and selling a stock.</p>


<p>But if you do have the history of price of a stock for the last n
days, it is certainly possible to determine the maximum profit that
could have been made. Instead, we are interested in finding the k1
lowest prices and k2 highest prices in the history.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>The input consists of a number of cases. The first line of each
case starts with positive integers n, k1, and k2 on a line (n <=
1,000,000, k1 + k2 <= n, k1, k2 <= 100). The next line contains
integers giving the prices of a stock in the last n days: the i-th
integer (1 <= i <= n) gives the stock price on day i. The stock prices
are non-negative. The input is terminated by n = k1 = k2 = 0, and that
case should not be processed.</p> 

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>For each case, produce three lines of output. The first line
contains the case number (starting from 1) on one line. The second
line specifies the days on which the k1 lowest stock prices occur. The
days are sorted in ascending order. The third line specifies the days
on which the k2 highest stock prices occur, and the days sorted in
descending order. The entries in each list should be separated by a
single space. If there are multiple correct lists for the lowest
prices, choose the lexicographically smallest list. If there are
multiple correct lists for the highest prices, choose the
lexicographically largest list.</p>

<h1>Sample Input</h1>
<pre>
10 3 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 3 2
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
0 0 0

<h1>Sample Output</h1>
<pre>
Case 1
1 2 3
10 9
Case 2
8 9 10
2 1
