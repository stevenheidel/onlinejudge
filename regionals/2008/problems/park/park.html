    <h1>Problem D: Walk in the Park</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>park.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br/><b>Input:</b> <tt>park.in</tt>
    <br/><b>Output:</b> <tt>park.out</tt>

<p>You are responsible for inspecting trees located in a park, to make 
sure they remain healthy.  The location of each tree is given to you as 
a point in the two-dimensional plane.  Due to recently-replanted grass, 
you are only allowed to walk through the park along a collection of 
paths.  Each path is described by an infinite-length horizontal or vertical 
line in the two-dimensional plane.</p>


<p>You are concerned that it may not be possible to view all the trees in the park from some vantage point on a path.  In particular, a tree is visible only if you can view it by standing on some path while facing perpendicular to the path. There must be no intervening tree that obstructs your view.</p>
    <h1>Input</h1>
<p>The input file contains a single park configuration in the form:
<blockquote><pre>
NTREES NPATHS
X(1) Y(1)
.
.
.
X(NTREES) Y(NTREES)
PATH(1)
.
.
.
PATH(NPATHS)
</pre></blockquote>
<p><tt>NTREES</tt> and <tt>NPATHS</tt> are integers in the range [1,100000].  The integer coordinates of the trees are given on the next <tt>NTREES</tt> lines.  This is followed by <tt>NPATHS</tt> lines, each of the form  <tt>x=C</tt> or <tt>y=C</tt> defining a vertical or horizontal path, where C is an integer in the range [-1000000,1000000].</p>

<p>All coordinates are in the range -1000000 &le; x,y &le; 1000000.  All trees are distinct and do not lie on any path, and all paths are distinct.</p>
    <h1>Output</h1>
    <p>The number of trees visible from some path.</p>
