    <h1>Problem E: Dance</h1>

<p>For a dance to be proper in the Altered Culture of Machinema, it must abide by the following rules:
</p><ol>
<li>A dip can only appear 1 or 2 steps after a jiggle, or before a twirl, as in:
<ul>
<li>...jiggle dip...</li>
<li>...jiggle stomp dip...</li>
<li>...dip twirl...</li>
</ul>
</li><li>All dances end with a clap stomp clap.</li>
<li>If a dance contains a twirl, it must have a hop.</li>
<li>No dance can start with a jiggle.</li>
<li>All dances must have a dip.</li>
</ol>

<p>As instructor at a dance composition school, you must grade many
freshman attempts at composing dances. You decide to make an automatic
grader that can check against these rules.</p>
    <h1>Input</h1>
    <p>The input consists of a number of dances, one per line.  Each
    dance has a maximum of 1000 steps. Each step is separated by a
    single space, and all steps are lowercase alphabetic words at most
    100 letters long.</p>

    <h1>Output</h1>
    <p></p>
<p>If a dance in the input has no mistakes, then the output should
contain the words "form ok: " followed by the original composition.</p>

<p>If a dance has a single type of form error, then the output should
contain the words "form error K: " where K is the rule which failed,
followed by the composition.</p>

<p>If a dance has multiple types of form errors, then the output should
contain the errors as a comma separated clause, as in "form errors
K(1), K(2), ..., K(N-1) and K(N): " where the form errors are in
increasing order, followed by the composition.</p>

<p>If a dance has form error 1, every dip in the dance that violates rule 1 should be printed in upper case.</p>
