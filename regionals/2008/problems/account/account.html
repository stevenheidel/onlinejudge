    <h1>Problem R: Savings Account</h1>

    <br><b>Source:</b> <tt>account.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br><b>Input:</b> <tt>account.in</tt>
    <br><b>Output:</b> <tt>account.out</tt>

<p>
Suppose you open a savings account with a certain initial balance. You
will not make any withdrawals or further deposits for a number of
years. The bank will compound your balance (add the annual interest)
once a year, on the anniversary of the opening of the account. Your
goal is to achieve a certain target amount in your savings account. In
how may years will the target amount be achieved?
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The input file will contain data for one or more test cases, one
  test case per line. Each line will contain three numbers: the
  initial balance, the annual interest rate (as a percentage of the balance), 
  and the target amount,
  separated by blank spaces. These will be positive numbers; they may
  or may not contain a decimal point. The target amount will be
  greater than the initial balance.  The input is terminated by
  end-of-file</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>For each line of input, your program will produce exactly one line
of output: This line will contain one positive integer value: the
number of years required to achieve the target amount.
</p>

<h2>Sample input</h2>

200.00 6.5 300
500 4 1000.00
