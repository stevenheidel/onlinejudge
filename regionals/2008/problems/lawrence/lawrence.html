    <h1>Problem B: Lawrence of Arabia</h1>

<p>T. E. Lawrence was a controversial figure during World War I. He
was a British officer who served in the Arabian theater and led a
group of Arab nationals in guerilla strikes against the Ottoman
Empire. His primary targets were the railroads. A highly fictionalized
version of his exploits was presented in the blockbuster movie,
"Lawrence of Arabia".</p>

<p>
You are to write a program to help Lawrence figure out how to best use
his limited resources. You have some information from British
Intelligence. First, the rail line is completely linear---there are
no branches, no spurs. Next, British Intelligence has assigned a
Strategic Importance to each depot---an integer from 1 to 5. A
depot is of no use on its own, it only has value if it is connected to
other depots. The Strategic Value of the entire railroad is calculated
by adding up the products of the Strategic Values for every pair of
depots that are connected, directly or indirectly, by the rail
line. Consider this railroad:
</p>
<center>
<img src="lawrence1.png" width="545" height="49" >
</center>
<p>
Its Strategic Value is 4*5 + 4*1 + 4*2 + 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2 = 49.
</p>

<p>
Now, suppose that Lawrence only has enough resources for one
attack. He cannot attack the depots themselves---they are too well
defended. He must attack the rail line between depots, in the middle
of the desert. Consider what would happen if Lawrence attacked this
rail line right in the middle:
</p>
<center>
<img src="lawrence2.png" width="545" height="81">
</center>
<p>
The Strategic Value of the remaining railroad is 4*5 + 1*2 = 22. But,
suppose Lawrence attacks between the 4 and 5 depots:
</p>
<center>
<img src="lawrence3.png"  width="545" height="81">
</center>
<p>
The Strategic Value of the remaining railroad is 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2 =
17. This is Lawrence's best option.
</p>

<p>
Given a description of a railroad and the number of attacks that
Lawrence can perform, figure out the smallest Strategic Value that he
can achieve for that railroad.
</p>

    <h1>Input</h1>
    <p>
There will be several data sets. Each data set will begin with a line
with two integers, <var>n</var> and <var>m</var>.  <var>n</var> is the
number of depots on the railroad (1≤<var>n</var>≤1000), and
<var>m</var> is the number of attacks Lawrence has resources for
(0≤<var>m</var>&lt;<var>n</var>). On the next line will be
<var>n</var> integers, each from 1 to 5, indicating the Strategic
Value of each depot in order. End of input will be marked by a line
with <var>n</var>=0 and <var>m</var>=0, which should not be processed.
</p>

    <h1>Output</h1>
    <p>For each data set, output a single integer, indicating the
    smallest Strategic Value for the railroad that Lawrence can
    achieve with his attacks. Output each integer in its own line.
