    <h1>Problem F: Trucking</h1>

    <br><b>Source:</b> <tt>trucking.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br><b>Input:</b> <tt>trucking.in</tt>
    <br><b>Output:</b> <tt>trucking.out</tt>

    <p>A certain local trucking company would like to transport some
    goods on a cargo truck from one place to another.  It is desirable
    to transport as much goods as possible each trip.  Unfortunately,
    one cannot always use the roads in the shortest route: some roads
    may have obstacles (e.g. bridge overpass, tunnels) which limit
    heights of the goods transported. Therefore, the company would
    like to transport as much as possible each trip, and then choose
    the shortest route that can be used to transport that
    amount.</p>

    <p>For the given cargo truck, maximizing the height of the goods
    transported is equivalent to maximizing the amount of goods
    transported. For safety reasons, there is a certain height limit
    for the cargo truck which cannot be exceeded.</p>

    <h1>Input</h1>
    <p>The input consists of a number of cases. Each case starts with
    two integers, separated by a space, on a line. These two integers
    are the number of cities (<var>C</var>) and the number of roads
    (<var>R</var>). There are at most 1000 cities, numbered from
    1. This is followed by <var>R</var> lines each containing the city
    numbers of the cities connected by that road, the maximum height
    allowed on that road, and the length of that road. The maximum
    height for each road is a positive integer, except that a height
    of -1 indicates that there is no height limit on that road. The
    length of each road is a positive integer at most 1000. Every road
    can be travelled in both directions, and there is at most one road
    connecting each distinct pair of cities. Finally, the last line of
    each case consists of the start and end city numbers, as well as
    the height limit (a positive integer) of the cargo truck. The
    input terminates when <var>C</var> = <var>R</var> = 0.</p>

    <h1>Output</h1>
    <p>For each case, print the case number followed by the maximum
    height of the cargo truck allowed and the length of the shortest
    route. Use the format as shown in the sample output. If it is not
    possible to reach the end city from the start city, print "cannot
    reach destination" after the case number. Print a blank line
    between the output of the cases.</p>
