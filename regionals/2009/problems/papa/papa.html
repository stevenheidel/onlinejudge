<p>
While cleaning your parents' attic, you discovered a box containing many documents describing the relationships among your ancestors. Given these documents, you are interested in answering a number of questions about the relationships implied by the document. Fortunately, all your ancestors have unique names so it is possible to make many inferences without any confusion.
</p>

<p>
It is assumed that all relationships (implied or given) satisfy the
following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A person can be either male, female, or have an unknown (undetermined by the data set) sex;</li>
  <li>a person can have at most one spouse (of the opposite sex), and X is Y's wife if and only if Y is X's husband;</li>
  <li>a person can have at most one mother and at most one father that can be inferred from the given data;</li>
  <li>if a person has a mother and father, then the mother and father are married;</li>
  <li>the children of a person's spouse are that person's children as well;</li>
  <li>the spouse of a son (or daughter) is not considered to be a
  daughter (or son). In other words, "sons" and "daughters" refer to
  biological sons and daughters.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The information provided will be consistent, and you may assume there are no hidden relationships that are not explicitly stated or implied by the above rules of consistency.
</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>
The first part of the input consists of a number of lines describing
the known relationships. Each relationship is listed on one line in
the form:
</p>
<pre>
NAME is NAME's RELATIONSHIP.
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>NAME</tt> is a lowercase alphabetic word (never 'is'), and <tt>RELATIONSHIP</tt> is one of
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>wife</tt></li>
  <li><tt>husband</tt></li>
  <li><tt>daughter</tt></li>
  <li><tt>son</tt></li>
  <li><tt>mother</tt></li>
  <li><tt>father</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
This first part is terminated by a blank line. You may assume that
there is at least one known relationship given, and there are at most
100 distinct names mentioned in the known relationships.
</p>

<p>
This is followed by a list of questions (one per line) of the form:
</p>
<pre>
is NAME NAME's RELATIONSHIP?
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>NAME</tt> is as before, but <tt>RELATIONSHIP</tt> is one of
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>wife</tt></li>
  <li><tt>husband</tt></li>
  <li><tt>daughter</tt></li>
  <li><tt>son</tt></li>
  <li><tt>mother</tt></li>
  <li><tt>father</tt></li>
  <li><tt>niece</tt>: <tt>X</tt> is a niece of <tt>Y</tt> if there are <tt>W</tt> and <tt>Z</tt> such that <tt>X</tt> is a daughter of <tt>W</tt>, and <tt>W</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are distinct children of <tt>Z</tt>.</li>
 <li><tt>nephew</tt>: <tt>X</tt> is a nephew of <tt>Y</tt> if there
  are <tt>W</tt> and <tt>Z</tt> such that <tt>X</tt> is a son of
  <tt>W</tt>, and <tt>W</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> are distinct children of <tt>Z</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>grandfather</tt>: <tt>X</tt> is a grandfather of <tt>Y</tt>
  if there is <tt>Z</tt> such that <tt>X</tt> is a father of
  <tt>Z</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt> is the father or mother of
  <tt>Y</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>grandmother</tt>: <tt>X</tt> is a grandmother of <tt>Y</tt> if there is <tt>Z</tt> such that <tt>X</tt> is a mother of <tt>Z</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt> is the father or mother of <tt>Y</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>grandson</tt>: <tt>X</tt> is a grandson of <tt>Y</tt> if
  there is <tt>Z</tt> such that <tt>X</tt> is a son of <tt>Z</tt>, and
  <tt>Z</tt> is a child of <tt>Y</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>granddaughter</tt>: <tt>X</tt> is a granddaughter of
  <tt>Y</tt> if there is <tt>Z</tt> such that <tt>X</tt> is a daughter
  of <tt>Z</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt> is a child of <tt>Y</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All names appearing in the questions will be mentioned in the list of
known relationships. The list of questions is terminated by the end of
file.
</p>

<h1>Output</h1>

<p>
For each question, print on a line <tt>yes</tt> or <tt>no</tt> if the answer of the
question can be determined, or <tt>unknown</tt> if the answer may be yes or
no because the sex of the relevant person(s) in the question cannot be
determined from the known relationships.
</p>
