    <h1>Problem Q: Problem Q: Health</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>health.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br/><b>Input:</b> <tt>console {stdin,cin,System.in}</tt>
    <br/><b>Output:</b> <tt>console {stdout,cout,System.out}</tt>
<p>
Annual membership at a health club costs <tt>M</tt> dollars. In addition to the
annual membership fee, members are normally charged an admission of <tt>A</tt>
dollars upon each visit. After <tt>F</tt> visits, however, members are entitled
to one free admission.
</p>

<p>
For example, if <tt>M = 100.00</tt>, <tt>A = 4.00</tt>, <tt>F = 10</tt>, and a particular member visited the club 60 times during the year, then five of the 60 visits were free. The total cost to the member is <tt>100.00 + 55 * 4.00 = 320.00</tt> and the average cost per visit is <tt>320.00 / 60 = 5.33</tt> (rounded to the nearest cent).
</p>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>
Each line of the input will contain data for one problem instance: positive values for <tt>M</tt>, <tt>A</tt> and <tt>F</tt> (defined above), and the actual number of visits <tt>V</tt>. <tt>M</tt> and <tt>A</tt> are positive floating point numbers (specified to two decimal places), <tt>F</tt> is a positive integer, and <tt>V</tt> is a non-negative integer. The end of input will be marked by end-of-file.
</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>
For each line of input, the output will consist of the average cost per visit, displayed with a precision of two decimal places, i.e., rounded to the nearest cent.
</p>

<h1>Sample Input</h1>
<pre>
100.00 4.00 10 60
100.00 4.00 10 55

<h1>Sample Output</h1>
