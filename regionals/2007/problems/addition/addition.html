<p>In
today's environment, students rely on calculators and computers to
perform simple arithmetic too much. Sadly, it is not uncommon to see
university students who cannot do simple arithmetic without electronic
aids. Professor Peano has had enough. He has decided to take the matter
into his own hands and force his students to become proficient in the
most basic arithmetic skill: addition of non-negative integers. Since
the students do not have a good foundation in this skill, he decided to
go back to the basics and represent non-negative integers with set
theory.</p><p>The non-negative integers are represented by the following sets:</p><p></p><ul><li> 0 is represented by the empty set {}.<br></li><li> For any number n &gt; 0, n is represented by a set containing the representations of all non-negative integers smaller than n.</li></ul><p>For example, the first 4 non-negative integers are represented by:<br></p><pre><br>  0 =&gt; {}<br>  1 =&gt; {{}}<br>  2 =&gt; {{},{{}}}<br>  3 =&gt; {{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}<br></pre><br>and
so on. Notice that the cardinality (size) of the set is exactly the
integer it represents. Although the elements of a set are generally
unordered, Professor Peano requires that the elements of a set be
ordered in increasing cardinality to make the assignments easier to
grade. As an added advantage, Professor Peano is sure that there are no
calculators or computer programs that can deal with numbers written in
this notation.<p>Not surprisingly, many students cannot cope with this
basic task and will fail the course if they do not get help soon. It is
up to you, an enterprising computer science student, to help them. You
have decided to write a computer program, codenamed Axiomatic Cheating
Machine (ACM), to sell to the students and help them perform the
additions to pass the course.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line
of the input contains a positive integer giving the number of cases to
follow. For each case, there are two lines of input each containing a
non-negative integer represented in set notation. Each line contains
only the characters '{', '}', and ','. The sum of the two given
integers will be at most 15.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output the sum of the two input integers in the set notation described above.</p><p></p><h2>Sample Input</h2><pre><br>3<br>{}<br>{}<br>{{}}<br>{{},{{}}}<br>{{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}<br>{{}}<br></pre><p></p><h2>Sample Output</h2><pre><br>{}<br>{{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}<br>{{},{{}},{{},{{}}},{{},{{}},{{},{{}}}}}<br></pre><p></p><p></p>
