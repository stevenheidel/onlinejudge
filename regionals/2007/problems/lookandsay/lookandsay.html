    <h1>Problem B: Look and Say</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Input</b>: <tt>lookandsay.in</tt><br>
      <b>Output</b>: <tt>lookandsay.out</tt>
    </p>
        
    <p>The
look and say sequence is defined as follows. Start with any string of
digits as the first element in the sequence. Each subsequent element is
defined from the previous one by "verbally" describing the previous
element. For example, the string 122344111 can be described as "one 1,
two 2's, one 3, two 4's, three 1's". Therefore, the element that comes
after 122344111 in the sequence is 1122132431. Similarly, the string
101 comes after 1111111111. Notice that it is generally not possible to
uniquely identify the previous element of a particular element. For
example, a string of 112213243 1's also yields 1122132431 as the next
element.</p>

   <h2>Input</h2>

   <p>The input consists of a number of cases. The first line gives 
the number of cases to follow. Each case consists of a line of up to
1000 digits.</p>

   <h2>Output</h2>

   <p>For each test case, print the string that follows the given string.</p>

   <h2>Sample Input</h2><pre><br>3<br>122344111<br>1111111111<br>12345<br></pre><p></p><h2>Sample Output</h2><pre><br>1122132431<br>101<br>1112131415<br></pre>
