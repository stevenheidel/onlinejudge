    <h1>Problem B: Ropes</h1>

    <br/><b>Source:</b> <tt>ropes.{c,cpp,java}</tt>
    <br/><b>Input:</b> <tt>console {stdin,cin,System.in}</tt>
    <br/><b>Output:</b> <tt>console {stdout,cout,System.out}</tt>

<p>When climbing a section or “pitch”, the lead climber ascends first,
taking a rope with them that they anchor to the rock for protection to
ascend. Once at the top of a pitch, the lead climber has the second
climber attach to the rope, so they can ascend with the safety of the
rope. Once the second climber reaches the top of the pitch, the third
attaches, and so on until all the climbers have ascended.</p>

<p>For example, for a 10 meter pitch and 50 meter rope, at most 6
climbers could ascend, with the last climber attaching to the end of
the rope. To ascend safely, there must be at least 2 climbers and the
rope must be at least as long as the pitch.</p>

<p>This process is repeated on each pitch of the climb, until the top
is reached. Then to descend, the climbing rope is hung at its midpoint
from an anchor (each half must reach the ground). The climbers then
each rappel from this rope. The rope is retrieved from the anchor by
pulling one side of the rope, slipping it though the anchor and
allowing it to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>To descend safely, the rope must be at least twice as long as the
sum of the lengths of the pitches.</p>

<p>For example, a 60 meter rope is required to rappel from a 30 meter
climb, no matter how many climbers are involved.</p>

<p>Climbing ropes come in 50, 60 and 70 meter lengths. It is best to
take the shortest rope needed for a given climb because this saves
weight. You are to determine the maximum number of climbers that can
use each type of rope on a given climb.</p>

<h1 class="break">Input</h1>

<p>The input consists of a number of cases. Each case specifies a
climb on a line, as a sequence of pitch lengths as in:</p>
<blockquote><tt>
N P<sub>1</sub> P<sub>2</sub> ... P<sub>N</sub>
</tt></blockquote>
<p>Here <tt>N</tt> is the positive number of pitches, with <tt>1 &le; N
&le; 100</tt>, and <tt>P<sub>k</sub></tt> is the positive integer
length (in meters) of each pitch, with <tt>1 &le; P<sub>k</sub> &le;
100</tt>. The last line (indicating the end of input) is a single
<tt>0</tt>.</p>

<h1>Output</h1>

<p>Three numbers for each climb separated by a space, indicating the
maximum number of climbers that could use the 50, 60, or 70 meter rope
lengths, respectively. State 0 if the given rope length is not
suitable for that climb.</p>
